Snoop Project
=============

### Snoop Project One of the most promising OSINT tools to search for nicknames
- [X] This is the most powerful software taking into account the CIS location.

Is your life slideshow? Ask Snoop.
Snoop project is developed without taking into account the opinions of the NSA and their friends,
that is, it is available to the average user *(project creation date: February 14, 2020)*.

> *Snoop is a research dev-work (own database/closed bugbounty) in the search and processing of public data on the Internet.
According to Snoop's specialized search, it is capable of competing with traditional search engines.*

                        By default, certificate verification on servers is disabled,

  --headers , -H <User-Agent>
                        Set the user-agent manually, the agent is enclosed in

  --quick, -q           Fast and aggressive search mode. Does not reprocess bad
                        resources, as a result of which the search is accelerated,
                        but Bad_raw also increases. Does not print intermediate results.
                        Consumes more resources. The mode is effective in full version
```

**Example**
```
# To search for only one user:
$ python3 snoop.py username1 #Running from source
$ snoop_cli username1 #Running from release linux
# Or, for example, Cyrillic is supported:
$ python3 snoop.py –æ–ª–µ—Å—è #Running from source
# To search for a name containing a space:
$ snoop_cli "bob dylan" #Running from release linux
$ snoop_cli dob_dylan #Running from release linux
$ snoop_cli bob-dylan #Running from release linux

# Running on Windows OS:
$ python snoop.py username1 #Running from source
$ snoop_cli.exe username1 #Running from release win
# To search for one or more users:
$ snoop_cli.exe username1 username2 username3 username4 #Running from release win

# Search for a lot of users-sorting the output of results by country;
# avoiding freezes on websites (more often the "dead zone" depends on the user's ip address);
# print only found accounts; save pages of found accounts locally;
# specify a file with a list of wanted accounts;
# connect to the expandable and updated web-base Snoop for search:
$ snoop_cli -—Å -t 6 -f -S -u ~/file.txt -w #Running from release linux
# check the Snoop database:
$ snoop_cli --list all #Running from release linux
# print the help for Snoop functions:
$ snoop_cli --help #Running from release linux

# Enable Snoop plugins:
$ snoop_cli --module #Running from release linux
```
+ 'ctrl-c' ‚Äî abort search.
+ The found accounts will be stored in `~/snoop/results/nicknames/*{txt|csv|html}`.
+ Open csv in office in, field separator **comma**.
+ Destroy **all** search results ‚Äî delete the '~/snoop/results' directory.
or `snoop_cli.exe --autoclean #Running from release OS Windows`.
```
# Update Snoop to test new features in the software
$ python3 snoop.py --update #Git installation is required

# Docker notes

If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

docker build -t snoop-image .
Once the image is built, snoop can be invoked by running the following:

docker run --rm -t -v "$PWD/results:/opt/snoop/results" snoop-image user123

# Using docker-compose
You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository and use this command:

`docker-compose run snoop user123`

Solving:
1. Reconfigure your Firewall *(for example, Kaspersky blocks resources for adults).*

2. Check the speed of your Internet connection:
`python3 snoop.py -v username`
If any of the network parameters are highlighted in red, Snoop may hang during the search.
At low speed, increase the 'x' value of the '--time-out x' option:
`python3 snoop.py -t 15 username`.

3. In fact, this is not a mistake. Fix username
*(for example, some sites do not allow Cyrillic characters; "spaces" or "Vietnamese-Chinese encoding"
in user names, in order to save time: - requests are filtered).*

4. **Change your IP address**
–°ensorship are the most common reasons why the user receives skip errors/false positives/and in some cases '**Alas**'.
When using Snoop from the IP address of the mobile operator's provider, the speed **may** drop significantly, depending on the provider.
For example, the most effective way to solve the problem is **TO USE A VPN**, Tor is not very well suited for this task.
Rule: one scan from one ip is not enough to get the most out of Snoop.

5. Open in the Snoop repository on Github-e Issue/Pull request
*(inform the developer about this).*

6. Do not pay attention, sites sometimes go for repair work and return to operation.

7. There is [problem](https://wiki.debian.org/ContinuousIntegration/TriagingTips/openssl-1.1.1 "the problem is simple and solvable") with openssl in some GNU/Linux distributions, and also the problem with sites that haven't been updated in years. These problems occur if the user intentionally started snoop with the '--cert-on' option.
Solving:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

# Edit the lines at the very bottom of the file:
[MinProtocol = TLSv1.2]
on
[MinProtocol = TLSv1]

[CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2]
on
[CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1]
```
